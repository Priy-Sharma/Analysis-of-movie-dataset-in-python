# Project Title
Movie Dataset Visualization
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize data from a movie dataset. By performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to uncover insights about the movie industry, such as trends in genres, box office performance, and ratings. This project serves as a comprehensive example of how to handle and extract meaningful information from a large dataset.
## Dataset

The data was sourced from <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv>, and it includes records from 1920 to 2017.
